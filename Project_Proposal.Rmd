## Introduction

We propose to create a linear model that can predict residential home prices in Melbourne (Australia) based on several explanatory variables. This project is a practical example of using real world data that consists of a mix of different data types - nominal, ordinal, discrete, and continuous variables.

Our final project will implement following phases:

  - Data cleansing
  - Variable Transformation
  - Outlier identification
  - Data analysis and interpretation
  - Model building
  - Model evaluation

## Dataset

We're using the Melbourne Housing Prices dataset from the following Kaggle site: https://www.kaggle.com/anthonypino/melbourne-housing-market.  This data pertains to the houses found in a given Melbourne (coastal capital of the southeastern Australian state of Victoria) area containing data from year 2016 to 2018.  

### Data Snippet

Here is a snippet of data with only first 10 columns considered.

```{r kable, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(readr)
mobility = read.csv("./Dataset/Housing_Full.csv")
knitr::kable(head(mobility)[,1:10])
```

### Data Description
The raw dataset contains **34857** observations and **21** variables ( X predictors and  X response).  Below is a list of few variables with descriptions taken from the original Kaggle site given above.  

- **Rooms**: Number of rooms
- **Price**: Price in dollars
- **Method**: S - property sold; SP - property sold prior; PI - property passed in; PN - sold prior not disclosed; SN - sold not disclosed; NB - no bid; VB - vendor bid; W - withdrawn prior to auction; SA - sold after auction; SS - sold after auction price not disclosed. N/A - price or highest bid not available.
- **Type**: br - bedroom(s); h - house,cottage,villa, semi,terrace; u - unit, duplex; t - townhouse; dev site - development site; o res - other residential.
- **SellerG**: Real Estate Agent
- **Date**: Date sold
- **Distance**: Distance from CBD
- **Suburb**: Suburb
- **Address**: House Address
- **Regionname**: General Region (West, North West, North, North east â€¦etc)
- **Propertycount**: Number of properties that exist in the suburb.
- **Bedroom2**: # of Bedrooms
- **Bathroom**: Number of Bathrooms
- **Car**: Number of carspots
- **Landsize**: Land Size
- **BuildingArea**: Building Size
- **CouncilArea**: Governing council for the area

### Required Criteria 

- A minimum 2000 observations
- At least 10 variables
- A numeric response variable - `Price`
- At least one categorical predictor- `Type`
- At least two continuous numeric predictors - `Landsize & Propertycount`

## Motivation

- Hands on experience with real life datasets.
- Practice with all techniques learnt in STAT420 course.
- Discover how applied statistics can help us answer Housing price prediction.
